                        There are two different versions of the Orion myth, depending on the identity of his parents.
                        The first of these identifies the sea-god Neptune as Orion's father and the the great huntress
                        Queen Euryale of the Amazons as his mother. Orion inherited her talent, and became the greatest
                        hunter in the world. Unfortunately for him, with his immense strength came an immense ego, and he
                        boasted that he could best any animal on earth. In response to his vanity, a single small scorpion
                        stung him and killed him.

                        Another version of the Orion myth states that he had no mother but was a gift to a pious peasant
                        from Jupiter, Neptune, and Mercury.
                        <span class="boldcontent">
                            "Orion supposedly was able to walk on water and had greater strength and stature than any other mortal
                            A skilled blacksmith, he fabricated a subterranean palace for Vulcan. He also walled in the coasts of
                            Sicily against the encroaching sea and built a temple to the gods there" (Magee, 48).
